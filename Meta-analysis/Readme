### UDMI IPDMA 2025

## June 2025

This code is intended to provide an example to facilitate future collaborative IPDMA

It is designed to be run as an R Project

The code will generate meta estimates of unadjusted and adjusted cox regression and subdistribution hazard ratio models derived at a cohort level
The code includes functions to extract data, to cycle through pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes by follow up time
The code for forest plots is also provided

Users should orientate themselves with 'ma-main.R' as a central script
The data structure required is demonstrated in 'Cohort Preparation' steps
File location is end user specific and requires updating should this be used in future

Support is not guaranteed but advice can be sought on discussion with the authors.

This script will be updated with the location of our final publication in due course.
